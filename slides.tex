\section{\scshape Region Inference}
\subsection{Key Ideas}
\begin{frame}{Region Inference}{Key Ideas}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Closures can capture local environments
        \pause
        \item Thus region accesses must be analyzed
        \pause
        \item Introduce an ``Effect System" to represent region accesses
        \begin{smashedalign}
        \epsilon = \{ get(\rho), put(\rho) \}
        \end{smashedalign}
        \pause
        \item ``Effects" should be part of the type of closures
        \begin{smashedalign}
            {\rm expression:}&~(\lambda y.(\mathtt{fst~} x, y) ~\ttbf{at}~ \rho_4) ~\ttbf{at}~ \rho_5
            \\
            {\rm has~type:}&~ (int, \rho_6) \xrightarrow{\epsilon.\{get(\rho_3), put(\rho_4)\}} ((int, \rho_1)*(int, \rho_6), \rho_4)
            \\
            {\rm place:}&~ \rho_5
            \\
            {\rm and~effect:}&~ \{put(\rho_5)\}
        \end{smashedalign}
        \pause
        \item If the type-and-place of an $e$ does not contain a $\rho$, then
        \pause
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Either $\rho$ is not accessed within $e$
            \pause
            \item Or $\rho$ does not escape out of $e$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{frame}{Limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Programmer should be concerned about inference
        % TODO example
        \item Hard to keep track of highly complex programs
        \item Small changes might cause a butterfly effect!
    \end{itemize}

\section{\scshape Cyclone}
\subsection{User-defined regions}
\begin{frame}{Cyclone: Safe C-like language}{User-defined regions}
    {\large Goals}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Guaranteed safety
        \pause
        \item Fine-grained control over resources
        \pause
        \item No hidden meanings -- minimal inference
        \pause
        \item And other usual systems language goals!
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \vspace{1em}
    \small Refer the report for a discussion of its semantics!
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Runtime implementation}
\begin{frame}{Cyclone: Runtime implementation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Regions are represented by a list of memory pages
        \pause
        \item When program exits the scope of a region, the list is freed
        \pause
        \item Dynamic regions were not thread-safe
        \pause
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sharing across threads should be through the heap-regions
            \item Heap regions conceptually live-forever and uses GC
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{frame}{Cyclone: Limitations}
    Extension to provide thread-safety guarantees (including data-race freedom for all objects) had significant overheads (according to proposal \cite{grossmanthread}):
    \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If a region is shared between threads,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Exiting ``the scope" should not free it
            \pause
            \item Thus, regions should maintain a \textit{list of threads} accessing it
            \pause
            \item This list must be protected by a mutex
            \pause
            \item When a thread exits, remove its entry from such lists
            \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item If a list becomes empty, free the region
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        \pause
        \item Increased complexity of type system to distinguish shared regions
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
    The above proposal was shelved!
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\scshape Linear Types}
\subsection{Definition}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Linear Types: Definition}
\textit{``Each object must be consumed exactly once."}

\vspace{1.6em}

An example:
\begin{lstlisting}
let a = 5;
let b = 6;
let c = add(a, b); // a and b are consumed
print(c); // c is consumed
print(a, b); // error!
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advantages}
\begin{frame}{Linear Types: Advantages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Safely reclaim resources after the (first) use
        \pause
        \item Statically enforce uniqueness when passing objects between threads
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Linear Types: Redefinition}
Objects are uniquely bound to variables.
\pause\par
Redefinition of ``consume" in terms of variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item A variable is consumed when it goes out of scope.
\pause
\item A variable is consumed when it appears in an expression.
\begin{lstlisting}
f(a);
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
let b = a;
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
a;
\end{lstlisting}
\texttt{a} is consumed in all three cases.
\end{itemize}
\pause
Resource reclamation is dependent on how the variable was consumed.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Relaxing Constraints}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Linear Types: Relaxing Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item Working with numbers are unnecessarily hard:

Introduce \texttt{Copy} types
\begin{itemize}
    \item Only get consumed by going out of scope
    \item All numeric types are examples (but in our discussion, floating point numbers are assumed to be non-\texttt{Copy})
\end{itemize}
\item Aliasing can be convenient:
\begin{lstlisting}
let a = [1, 3, 5];
let c = add(get(a, 0), get(a, 2)); // error!
\end{lstlisting}
Introduce ``Borrowing"...
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Borrowing}
\begin{frame}{Borrowing}
As far as safety is concerned, it is okay to
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Temporarily} alias as long as only one reference remains when consumed.
    \item Modify in-place as long as only one active reference exists when modified.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
